> This is a complete rewrite of the original [Markdown Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.MarkdownEditor64) with tons of fixes, tweeks, and performance improvements. A few little-used features are not being ported to this new extension, so if you rely on them you should keep using the original.

### Live Preview Window
The preview window opens up on the right side of the document when it opens.

Every time the markdown document is modified, the preview window will update.

The preview window is automatically scrolled to match the scroll position of the document. As the document is scrolled up and down, the preview window will follow.

Live preview can be disabled in the [settings](#settings).

### Syntax highlighting
All fonts can be changed in **Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Fonts and Colors** dialog.

#### GitHub and other flavors
Advanced markdown extensions are supported to give more features to the syntax. This includes pipe tables, emoji, mathematics and a lot
more.

### IntelliSense
You get full IntelliSense for over 1,600 emoji and smiley characters.

### Heading-based navigation
The NavigationBar shows all of the document headings, like a table of contents. Select a heading to jump to that section of the document.

### Drag 'n drop images
Drag an image directly from Solution Explorer onto the document to insert the appropriate markdown that will render the image.

### Paste images
This is really helpful for copying images from a browser or for inserting screen shots. Simply copy an image into the clipboard and paste it directly into the document. This will prompt you for a file name relative to the document and then it inserts the appropriate markdown.

It will even parse the file name and make a friendly name to use for the alt text.

### Outlining
Any fenced code and HTML blocks can be collapsed, so that this:

...can be collapsed into this:

### Keyboard shortcuts
**Ctrl+Alt+R** Refresh the preview window.

**Ctrl+Alt+K** Inserts a new link.

**Ctrl+B** makes the selected text bold by wrapping it with `**`.

**Ctrl+I** makes the selected text italic by wrapping it with `_`.

<!--**Ctrl+Shift+C** wraps the selected text in a code block.-->
**Ctrl+Space** checks and unchecks task list items.

```markdown
- [x] task list item
```

**Tab** increases indentation of list items.

**Shift+Tab** decreases indentation of list items.

**Ctrl+K,C** wraps the selection with HTML comments.

**Ctrl+K,U** removes HTML comments surrounding the selection/caret.

<!--**Ctrl+PgUp** moves caret to previous heading

**Ctrl+PgDown** moves caret to next heading-->

## Validation
Relative URLs are validated and will show a red squiggly when they can't be resolved.

The errors will also be listed in the Error List.

### How can I help?

Should you encounter bugs or if you have feature requests, head on over to the [GitHub repo][repo] to open an issue if one doesn't already exist.

Pull requests are also very welcome, since I can't always get around to fixing all bugs myself. This is a personal passion project, so my time is limited.
